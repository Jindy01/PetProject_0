#sass-watch
It's like sass --watch, but for Node!



##Installation:
``` npm install -g sass-watch```



##Usage:
``` sass-watch path/to/input/directory path/to/output/directory```


```sass-watch``` is really simple.  Like, really.  All it does is watch a directory, and when scss files in the input directory are added/changed/deleted, those changes are reflected in the compiled css files in the output directory.
